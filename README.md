# [DiceKeys](https://dicekeys.com/) PostMessage Api

This package contains the [DiceKeys app](https://dicekeys.app/)'s Application Programming Interface (API),
for use by websites and browser-based via the browser's PostMessage interface.

Your app can use this API to ask the user to user their DiceKey to:

  - Derive a password or secret from the user's DiceKey
  - Derive a cryptographic key from the user's DiceKey
  - Unseal (decrypt and authenticate) secrets encrypted with
    keys derived from the user's DiceKey
  - Sign messages with a signing key derived from the user's
    DiceKey

```ts
import {
  Recipe,
  getPassword
} from "@dicekeys/dicekeys-api-js"

// See https://dicekeys.github.io/seeded-crypto/recipe_format.html
const recipe = JSON.stringify(Recipe({
  type: "Secret",
  mutable: true,
  wordLimit: 13,
  allow: [{"host": document.location.host}]
}));

// Call the API to request a password specific to this host
// derived from the user's DiceKey
const {password} = await getPassword({recipe});
```
